## Built On Rails

**Q**: What do you do when someone asks, "does anybody use Rails anymore?"

**A**: Send them to [builtonrails.com](http://builtonrails.com)!

[builtonrails.com](http://builtonrails.com) is an effort to collect a definitive list of the companies and applications that rely on Rails every day.

### Contributing
Want to add an app to the list? Add your app to [`_data/apps.yml`](https://github.com/alextaylor000/builtonrails.com/blob/master/_data/apps.yml) and open a Pull Request.

You can use [`_data/template.yml`](https://github.com/alextaylor000/builtonrails.com/blob/master/_data/template.yml) to get setup quickly.

We also welcome other improvements and fixes to the site itself. Please submit a PR! :heart:

### Development
Start a development server with `./serve.sh` or `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
